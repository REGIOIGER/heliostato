 * @brief program entry point
 *
 * Changelog
 * ---------
 * 14-10-06: The LED attached to P1.0 is toggled in an infite loop.
 * 14-10-19: Configure clock module for MCLK = 1MHz and the LED to blink at 2Hz.
 *           Configure P1.3 as digital input and wait for button press before blinking
 * 14-11-13: Update for board rev 1.5. P1.3 no longer has a pull-up resistor so the
 *           internal pull-up must be enabled
